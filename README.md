# IP Passing

Investigating if user's local IP address can be passed into the mock terminal used
in Code Institute's PP3 project.

Another student had been working on an interesting application that would have had
better functionality had the user's IP address been available.  
I suspect an environment variable may be configurable via Node, and then accessed by
the `os` package with Python. However, I have not had time to investigate this further;
it is, as they say, on the back burner for now.

An interesting challenge, but not one that has many useful applications!

One day I may return to investigate further!
